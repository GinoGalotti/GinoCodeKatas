# GinoCodeKatas
Here you're going to find some of the Katas that I usually perfom in order to stay sharp and gain expertise with languages and tools.

Each one is described in his own package through the package-info file. If you think that I should try another ones, or do you have any feedback regarding how to improve them; feel free to contact me!!
